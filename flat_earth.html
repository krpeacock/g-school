      <h1>The Flat Earth Myth</h1>
      <h2>Why some accusations stick</h2>
      <p>Did you know that up until modern times, Christians believed that the Earth was flat? You aren't alone. Today, it is common knowledge that the "Dark Ages" were a time of little to no scientific advancement, where the church suppressed scientific development by clinging to the Bible despite conflicting evidence.</p>
      <p>If you still think that most Medieval Christians believed in a flat Earth, prepare to be surprised. This commonly repeated story is false. If it is false, where did the idea come from? If you think that it was originally anti-Christian propaganda, you'd be wrong. Or, at least partially wrong. Let's explain.</p>

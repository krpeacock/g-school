      <h1>The Flat Earth Myth</h1>
      <h2>Why some accusations stick</h2>
      <p>Did you know that up until modern times, Christians believed that the Earth was flat? You aren't alone. Today, it is common knowledge that the "Dark Ages" were a time of little to no scientific advancement, where the church suppressed scientific development by clinging to the Bible despite conflicting evidence.</p>
      <p>If you still think that most Medieval Christians believed in a flat Earth, prepare to be surprised. This commonly repeated story is false. If it is false, where did the idea come from? If you think that it was originally anti-Christian propaganda, you'd be wrong. Or, at least partially wrong. Let's explain.</p>
      <p>"Those science-denying idiots believe the Earth is flat!"</p>
      <p>This elegant accusation originally served as anti-Catholic propaganda, and was perpetuated by Protestant Christians. To briefly summarize the conflict, there was a significant break in a (mostly) unified church in the ____th century. The Protestants "protested" against some Catholic doctrines that developed over the years. Some of these arguments were extremely political in nature. </p>

      <p>There's a basic formula here, and it's extremely informative.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Group of people you don't like</li>
          <ul><li>In this case, the Catholic Church</li></ul>
        <li>Some undeniably true detail</li>
          <ul><li>Dogma changes more slowly than science</li></ul>
        <li>Wild assertion that requires nuance to respond to</li>
          <ul><li>Those Catholics can't accept the scientific fact of the Earth being a globe!</li></ul>
      <p>hi</p>
